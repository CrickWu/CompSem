Motivation of Word embedding 

Most popular method is point estimation

Recently, some interesting works on distribution representation of word
Andrew McCallum \cite{vilnis2014word} and
Andrew G. Wilson \cite{athiwaratkun2017multimodal} work

we propose to extend to existing work (Andrew Wilson) on two directions:

\paragraph{Changing Gaussian distribution assumption}
Changing distribution assumptions and porpose new learning/inference algorihtm is proposed:
xisting work assume either gaussian or  

\paragraph{Learning with WordNet as regularization}
